struct Point {

fn main() {
    let p: Point = Point { x: 0 , y: 10 };

    match p {
        /*
        In Rust, pattern matching is used to destructure data and optionally match literal values.

        Variable Binding: Captures the value of a component.

        match p {
            Point { x, y } => println!("x is {x} and y is {y}"),
        }
        Here, x and y are variable bindings that capture the values of p.x and p.y.

        Literal Match: Checks if a component matches a specific value.


        match p {
            Point { x, y: 0 } => println!("On the x axis at {x}"),
            Point { x, y } => println!("On neither axis: ({x}, {y})"),
        }
        Here, y: 0 checks if y is 0. It doesn't bind y as a variable.


        - `Point { x, y: 0 }` matches only if y is 0. x is bound to p.x.
        
        - `Point { x, y }` matches any Point, binding `x` to `p.x` and `y` to `p.y`.

        In Rust, y: 0 in pattern matching is a literal match, not a variable binding.
        In JavaScript, y: newY in destructuring is used to rename a property.

        The first arm will match any point that lies on the x axis by specifying that the y field matches if its value matches the literal 0. The pattern still creates an x variable that we can use in the code for this arm.

        We can also destructure with literal values as part of the struct pattern rather than creating variables for all the fields. Doing so allows us to test some of the fields for particular values while creating variables to destructure the other fields.


        Key Points
        Literal vs. Variable Binding:
        Point { x, y: 0 } is checking if the y field of Point is exactly 0. This is a literal match.
        Point { x, y } is binding the value of the y field to a variable named y.
        
        Purpose of Literal Matching:
        When you specify y: 0, you are not interested in capturing the value of y; you are asserting that y must be 0 for the pattern to match.
        Since you are not capturing y (you're merely checking it), the language does not create a binding for y.
        Language Design Philosophy:

        Rust's pattern matching syntax distinguishes between matching values and binding variables for clarity and to avoid ambiguity.
        Allowing the use of y in the arm where y: 0 could create confusion about whether y is a variable or a value.


        Here, `x` and `y` in the pattern (`Point { x , y }`) are placeholders or variables that we are creating to bind/assign the values of the `x` and `y` fields from the `Point` struct `p` Specifically:
            - `x`: This variable is being bound to the value of the `x` field of the `Point` struct `p` that
            matches the pattern. In other words, `x` will hold the value of `p.x`.
            - `y`: Similarly, this variable is being bound to the value of the `y` field of the Point struct p that matches the pattern. So, `y` will hold the value of `p.y`.

        Point { x, y } => println!("x: {}, y: {}", x, y)

        In the match arm `Point { x: 0, y }`, `y` is being bound to the value of the `y` field of the `Point` struct `p`. However, `x` is not being directly used in this arm, it's only being pattern matched against the value `0` â€“ `0` is not bound to `x`.

        the variables `x` and `y` created within the match arm to hold the values extracted from the `Point` struct `p`. These bindings are only valid within the scope of that match arm.

        Point { x: 0 , y } => println!("2. On the a axis at and b axis at {} and {}", p.x, y),

        /*
        x: a: Here, we are matching the x field of the Point struct p with a new variable a. So, a is bound to the value of the x field of p.
        y: b: Similarly, we are matching the y field of the Point struct p with a new variable b. b is bound to the value of the y field of p.
        Then, we use these newly bound variables a and b within the println! macro to print the values.

        So, in this notation:

        a represents the value of the x field of p.
        b represents the value of the y field of p.
        These bindings are specific to this match arm and are only valid within its scope. They are separate from the fields x and y declared in the Point struct.
