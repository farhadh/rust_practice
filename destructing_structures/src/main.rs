        Here, `x` and `y` in the pattern (`Point { x , y }`) are placeholders or variables that we are creating to bind/assign the values of the `x` and `y` fields from the `Point` struct `p` Specifically:
            - `x`: This variable is being bound to the value of the `x` field of the `Point` struct `p` that
            matches the pattern. In other words, `x` will hold the value of `p.x`.
            - `y`: Similarly, this variable is being bound to the value of the `y` field of the Point struct p that matches the pattern. So, `y` will hold the value of `p.y`.

        Point { x, y } => println!("x: {}, y: {}", x, y)

        In the match arm `Point { x: 0, y }`, `y` is being bound to the value of the `y` field of the `Point` struct `p`. However, `x` is not being directly used in this arm, it's only being pattern matched against the value `0` â€“ `0` is not bound to `x`.

        the variables `x` and `y` created within the match arm to hold the values extracted from the `Point` struct `p`. These bindings are only valid within the scope of that match arm.

        x: a: Here, we are matching the x field of the Point struct p with a new variable a. So, a is bound to the value of the x field of p.
        y: b: Similarly, we are matching the y field of the Point struct p with a new variable b. b is bound to the value of the y field of p.
        Then, we use these newly bound variables a and b within the println! macro to print the values.

        So, in this notation:

        a represents the value of the x field of p.
        b represents the value of the y field of p.
        These bindings are specific to this match arm and are only valid within its scope. They are separate from the fields x and y declared in the Point struct.
